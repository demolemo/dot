# dot DOT dot
Collection of dot files and scripts to make experience of working on a remote machine pleasant.

## Description
This just works.

**Tooling:**
- `zsh`: `bash` but happier
- `bat`: `cat` with wings (syntax highlighting, scrolling by default, git integration)
- `ripgrep (rg)`: *the `grep` is dead, long live the `grep`*. (faster, respects `.gitignore`)
- `eza`: `ls` with icons, grug love picture ü™®üëç
- `curl/wget`: MJ of HTTP/LeBron of HTTP
- `fzf`: fuzzy-finder across directories

**Config files:**
- `.zshrc`: for lazy people like myself
- `.wgetrc`: because why not

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/demolemo/dot
cd dot
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
